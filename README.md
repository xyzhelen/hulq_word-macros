# Transliterator word macros for hul'q'umi'num'

These 2 macros transliterate between the 2002 practical orthography uesd by HLCS and APA phonetics
- to_Orthography
- to_APA

Same as above but transliterate text based on the font. Requires the "BC Sans" font to be installed. This is useful if you need to convert an entire document which contains both Hul'q'umi'num' and English. First you have to change all the Hul'q'umi'num' text to the BC Sans font, then run the macro and it will not affect text in other fonts.
- BCsans_to_APA
- BCsans_to_Orthography
