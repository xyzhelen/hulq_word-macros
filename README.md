## word macros for hul'q'umi'num'

These 2 macros transliterate between the practical orthography and APA phonetics
- to_Orthography
- to_APA

Same as above but transliterate text based on the font. Requires the "BC Sans" font to be installed. Useful if you need to convert an entire document.
- BCsans_to_APA
- BCsans_to_Orthography

These convert text typed in "Straight" font into Unicode. Requires the Straight font to be installed (or any font thats named "Straight").
- StraightDonna_Unicode (the Straight font originally made for Macs)
- StraightBarbara_Unicode (the Straight font originally made for Windows)
